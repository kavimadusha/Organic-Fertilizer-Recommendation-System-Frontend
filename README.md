# EcoGrowAdviser: Organic Fertilizer Recommendation System
<hr>
  
This project was done to overcome the environmental impact of inorganic fertilizers used in Sri Lanka. This Organic Fertilizer Recommendation system allows the farmers to enter the crop type, crop age and compost NPK ratio to calculate the required compost amount and suggest the amounts of natural sources needed to apply for the crop field to maximize crop harvest. This system uses NPK sensors to detect  NPK levels.
