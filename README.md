# EcoGrowAdviser: Organic Fertilizer Recommendation System
<hr>
  
This project was done to overcome the environmental impact of inorganic fertilizers used in Sri Lanka. This Organic Fertilizer Recommendation system allows the farmers to enter the crop type, and crop age to calculate and suggest the required compost amount and the amounts of natural sources needed to apply for the crop field based on the crop NPK requirement and the soil NPK ratio to maximize crop harvest. This system uses NPK sensors to detect NPK levels from both soil and compost that are used to crop cultivation.
